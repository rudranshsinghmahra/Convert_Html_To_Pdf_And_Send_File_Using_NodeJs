# Convert_Html_To_Pdf_And_Send_File_Using_NodeJs
In this API we have first Converted the HTML file to PDF using Handlebars and Puppeteers and then used NodeMailer Library To send the converted File to some mail address.
<p>Note - The node_modules dir is missing as it is having more than 100 files so it cant be uploaded.</p>
<p>To install the dependencies for the node_modules dir open your terminal and type <h3>npm i nodemailer -S </h3> -S to save the dependency this will install the nodemailer module</p>
<p>Further Type:- <h3>npm install dotenv -S </h3> So that the senders mail address and password is not visible to public.</p>
<p>Next Module we have to install is <h3>npm i handlebars puppeteers</h3> this will install the Handlebar and Puppeteers Library</p>
<p>To start the program type <h3>node filename.extension</h3> in this case <h3>node server.js</h3> to run your program.
